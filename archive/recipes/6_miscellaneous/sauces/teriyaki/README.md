### Ingredients
* 1 cup water
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

#### Thickening
* 1/4 cup water
* 2 tablespoon cornstarch/potato starch

### Step-by-Step
1. Combine all ingredients in sauce pan over medium heat and bring to a boil, whisking frequently.
2. While sauce comes to a boil, create a slurry by adding 1/4 cup water and cornstarch to a small bowl, then whisking until cornstarch is dissolved.
3. Pour the slurry in the saucepan, then bring the sauce back to a boil, whisking frequently. Once boiling, cook for 1-2 minutes or until desired thickness is reached. For best results, sauce should easily coat the back of a spoon.
4. Remove teriyaki sauce from heat and let cool slightly, about 5-10 minutes.
