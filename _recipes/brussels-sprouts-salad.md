instructions:
  - step: Fry the bacon over low heat until crispy. Drain on paper towels; crumble and set aside.
  - step: Shred or slice the brussels sprouts. I've found the absolute best way to do this is with a handy dandy mandoline â€“ slice them super thin and then break the layers apart with your hands. Fluff it up a little and you'll get a delicate shredded texture.
  - step: Prep the pomegranate seeds. Place the almonds in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Toss the brussels sprouts, bacon crumbles, pomegranate arils, almonds, and cheese together.
  - step: Place all the dressing ingredients in a food processor and pulse until creamy. Add the water as needed for consistency. Toss the salad with the dressing and serve immediately.
