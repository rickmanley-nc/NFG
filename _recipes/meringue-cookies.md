  - group: Main Ingredients
    items:
      - item: egg whites
        amount: 4
        unit: large
        note: room temperature
      - item: cream of tartar
        amount: 1/2
        unit: teaspoon
      - item: salt
        amount: 1/8
        unit: teaspoon
      - item: granulated sugar
        amount: 1
        unit: cup
      - item: vanilla extract
        amount: 1
        unit: teaspoon
instructions:
  - group: Preparation
    steps:
      - step: Preheat oven to 225째F (105째C) and line a large cookie sheet (or two regular-sized cookie sheets) with parchment paper. Set aside.
      - step: Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in a large, completely clean, completely grease-free bowl.
  - group: Mixing
    steps:
      - step: Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer (with either the whisk or paddle attachment), stir on low speed until mixture becomes foamy.
      - step: Increase speed to high.
      - step: With mixer on high, gradually add sugar, about 1 Tablespoon at a time, stirring after each addition until sugar is dissolved (about 15-20 seconds between each addition).
      - step: Beat until mixture is thick, shiny, and has increased in volume. Mixture should have stiff peaks and sugar should be completely dissolved (you can test this by rubbing a small bit of the mixture between your fingers, if it feels gritty, the sugar isn't dissolved).
      - step: Stir in vanilla extract and any other extract you may like to use. If using food coloring, add it at this stage.
  - group: Piping and Baking
    steps:
      - step: Fit a large disposable piping bag with a large star tip (Ateco 846 recommended) and transfer meringue to prepared piping bag.
      - step: Pipe onto prepared cookie sheet. The meringue cookies can be close to each other as they won't spread.
      - step: Bake on 225째F (105째C) for 1 hour.
      - step: Turn off the oven once the baking time has passed, and do not open the oven.
      - step: Leave the oven door closed and allow cookies to cool completely in the oven (1-2 hours) before removing.
