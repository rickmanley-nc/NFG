  - step: Add shredded carrots, garlic, and ginger and saute for 2 minutes. Stir the vegetables and turkey together.
  - step: Pour chicken broth in the pan and scrape the bottom of it to deglaze it.
  - step: Add cabbage, coconut aminos or soy sauce, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Stir well and cover with a lid. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until cabbage is to your desired tenderness.
  - step: Just before serving add toasted sesame oil, top with green onions and toasted sesame seeds, and texas pete, if desired.
notes: This is a great meal prep recipe that reheats well. For a lower-carb version, you can use coconut aminos instead of soy sauce.
