  - step: Mix all filling ingredients together until well combined.
  - step: Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each wrapper.
  - step: Wet the edges of the wrapper with water, fold in half, and pinch to seal, creating pleats along the edge.
  - step: Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
  - step: Place gyoza in the pan and cook until bottoms are golden brown (about 3 minutes).
  - step: Add water, cover with a lid, and steam until water evaporates (about 3 minutes).
  - step: Remove lid and drizzle with sesame oil. Cook until bottoms are crispy.
  - step: Mix dipping sauce ingredients together and serve with hot gyoza.
notes: For best results, don't overfill the wrappers and make sure to seal them well to prevent leaking during cooking.
